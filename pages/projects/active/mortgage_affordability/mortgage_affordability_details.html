				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>The increasing complexity of financial markets and the myriad of choices available have made financial decision-making, particularly concerning mortgages, a daunting task for many individuals. With fluctuations in mortgage rates and diverse lending practices, potential homeowners often find it challenging to accurately assess the mortgage amount they can comfortably afford. This program is designed to alleviate this difficulty by offering an intelligent, automated, and personalized budgeting solution.
				</p>
				<p>This program leverages the power of web crawling to gather up-to-date mortgage rates, providing users with real-time, accurate data. By integrating these rates with established lending best practices, it offers users a comprehensive overview of their mortgage affordability. Through this process, the program empowers individuals to make informed decisions, thereby promoting financial literacy and responsible homeownership.
				</p>
				<p>In essence, this program serves as a practical tool for prospective homeowners, financial advisors, and anyone seeking to understand and navigate the mortgage landscape with greater confidence and ease. It brings transparency and simplicity to the often complex process of mortgage planning, thus becoming an indispensable part of the financial decision-making process.
				</p>
				<h2>Implementation</h2>
				<p>The Mortgage Affordability App is a sophisticated software system that, given a user's financial data and web-crawled mortgage rates, can provide an accurate estimate of the mortgage amount a user can afford. The application also integrates established lending best practices to provide a comprehensive and realistic evaluation.</p>

				<h4>Mortgage Affordability Demonstration</h4>

				<div class="row">
					<div class="column left">
						<p>The first step of the application involves an in-depth budgeting exercise and affordability analysis. Users input their financial data, including income, expenses, and savings, into the application. The application then uses this data to assess the user's financial health and calculate a mortgage amount they can comfortably afford. This is achieved by considering their budget and current mortgage rates, which the program gathers via a web crawler from various financial institutions.</p>					</div>

					</div>
				</div>


				<div class="row">
					<div class="column left">
						<p>After the budgeting exercise and affordability analysis, the second step of the application generates a personalized affordability output. This includes a text file that contains an amortization table. The table breaks down the mortgage payments over time, showing the principal and interest components of each payment. This comprehensive information provides users with a detailed understanding of their potential mortgage payments, enabling them to make informed decisions regarding their home purchase.</p>
