					<h2>Industrial Control Systems: Logic Bomb</h2>
					<p>Using Factory IO and Control IO, I modeled an industrial control system (ICS)
						and programmed logic bombs to simulate real-life cyber-physical threats.</p>

					<h2>Background</h2>
					<p>In order to understand the concepts of cyber-physical systems (CPS), it is necessary to get familiar with their control logics and mechanisms.
						In this project, I modeled an industrial control system (ICS) using Factory I/O coupled with Control I/O.
						Logic bombs were introduced to the environment after specific conditions were met.
					</p>
					<h2>Implementation</h2>
					<p>A logic bomb is a set of instructions incorporated into a program so that if some condition is met,
					the instructions will be executed. In this project, the logic bombs resulted in a change to the normal operation
					that might have resulted in an unobserved harmful downstream effect.</p>
					<h4>Role</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Controls Engineer:</b> Responsible for configuring PLC logic, conducting simulation and verification, and supporting validation of requirements.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Key Activities/Deliverables</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><b>Factory I/O:</b> Factory I/O was used to create the 3-D model of the industrial control processes.</li>
						<li><b>Control I/O:</b> Control I/O was used to program the controller under normal operating conditions and implement the logic bombs.</li>
						<li><b>Controller Logic:</b> Led the controls development, design, programming, and implementation used in the process control systems.</li>
						<li><b>System Testing:</b> Troubleshot systems to ensure no bugs were present and requirements were met.</li>
					</ul>

					<h4>Key Features</h4>
					<ul>
						<li><b>System Automation:</b> Fully autonomous operation with minimal human interaction. Sensors and actuators were programmed to require zero intervention under normal operating conditions.</li>
						<li><b>Logic Bomb:</b> Programmed logic bombs to trigger after specific conditions were met.
							Logic bombs contained features that disrupted normal operating conditions and disabled shutdown/ kill-switch functionality.</li>
	</ul>
					<h4>Logic Bomb Demonstration: Scene 3</h4>

					<div class="row">
						<div class="column left">
							<p>Under normal operating conditions, the Scene 3 sorting station should sort Green lids to the right (toward the camera), Gray lids to the left, and Blue lids to the middle. The lid+base should continue travelling down the respective conveyor belt and be removed by the Remover. </p>
						</div>


						<div class="column right">

						</div>
					</div>


					<div class="row">
						<div class="column left">
							<p>The logic bomb caused the sorting of green and gray packages to switch.
								Because there were no changes to the control box logic, incorrect numbers were reported.
								Finally, the system stopped responding to the start and stop buttons after the logic bomb was triggered.</p>
						</div>
