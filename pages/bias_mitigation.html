        <h3>This project examined the impact of using biased data that could be used to train algorithms
            associated with learning from credit-based data sets.
        </h3>
        <p>Industry-defined fairness metrics were used to assess whether bias was present in the data.
            A bias-mitigating technique was then applied to produce a dataset without bias.</p>

            <h3>Enhanced Fairness in <br>Loan Approvals</h3>
            <p>The implementation of bias mitigation techniques resulted in a fairer loan approval process.
                By addressing biases related to age and gender, the project ensured more equitable treatment of all applicants,
                leading to increased trust and fairness in the decision-making process.</p>

            <h3>Improved Accuracy of <br>AI Models</h3>
            <p>Through the application of bias detection and mitigation, the accuracy of AI models was significantly enhanced.
                This improvement in model accuracy helped in making more reliable predictions,
                ultimately reducing the risk of incorrect loan approvals and denials.</p>

            <p>The project reinforced ethical standards by integrating fairness metrics into the data processing pipeline.
                Ensuring that the AI models adhered to these ethical guidelines minimized discrimination,
                promoting ethical AI usage and compliance with regulatory standards.</p>

                <h3>Raw Data Collection and Initial Discrimination Unit Testing</h3>
                <p>The project began with gathering raw data and performing an initial discrimination data unit test to assess the presence of bias using dataset metrics. Specifically, metrics such as Statistical Parity Difference (SPD) and Disparate Impact (DI) were used to evaluate potential biases in relation to protected attributes like gender and age. This step was essential to highlight potential biases in the data, ensuring that any discriminatory patterns were flagged for further processing.</p>

                <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
                <p>Upon detecting bias, a pre-processing algorithm was applied to mitigate discrimination before splitting the data into training and testing sets. This crucial step involved managing missing data and grouping protected class variables into distinct subcategories, transforming the raw dataset into a format suitable for further analysis. These preprocessing tasks were accomplished using powerful data manipulation libraries in Python, namely pandas and numpy.</p>

                <h3>Training and Testing</h3>
                <p>The training data underwent standard training and in-processing algorithms to enhance fairness during model training. The testing data was used to evaluate the model's performance, focusing on both accuracy and fairness metrics. This phase ensured that the AI models were trained to be both effective and equitable.</p>

                <h3>Post-processing Bias Mitigation and Model Evaluation</h3>
                <p>Post-processing algorithms were applied to further reduce any remaining bias after model training. The Disparate Impact Remover (DIR) algorithm from the AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) toolkit was utilized to adjust the distributions of privileged and unprivileged groups for each feature to be more similar. The classifier's performance was continually assessed for both accuracy and fairness using classifier unit tests and dataset metrics.</p>

                <p>After ensuring the model met the required fairness and accuracy standards, it was deployed. The model's performance and fairness were continuously monitored, with external interventions applied as necessary to reprocess and retrain the model to maintain fairness. This ongoing monitoring was crucial for ensuring the responsible use of AI in loan approvals.</p>
