        <h3>This project examined the impact of using biased data that could be used to train algorithms
            associated with learning from credit-based data sets.
        </h3>
        <p>Industry-defined fairness metrics were used to assess whether bias was present in the data.
            A bias-mitigating technique was then applied to produce a dataset without bias.</p>

            <h3>Enhanced Fairness in <br>Loan Approvals</h3>
            <p>The implementation of bias mitigation techniques resulted in a fairer loan approval process.
                By addressing biases related to age and gender, the project ensured more equitable treatment of all applicants,
                leading to increased trust and fairness in the decision-making process.</p>

            <h3>Improved Accuracy of <br>AI Models</h3>
            <p>Through the application of bias detection and mitigation, the accuracy of AI models was significantly enhanced.
                This improvement in model accuracy helped in making more reliable predictions,
                ultimately reducing the risk of incorrect loan approvals and denials.</p>

            <h3>Strengthened Ethical <br>Compliance</h3>
            <p>The project reinforced ethical standards by integrating fairness metrics into the data processing pipeline.
                Ensuring that the AI models adhered to these ethical guidelines minimized discrimination,
                promoting ethical AI usage and compliance with regulatory standards.</p>

            <h3>Data Preprocessing</h3>
            <p>The project kicked off with a thorough preprocessing phase where the raw dataset was transformed to be suitable for further analysis. This crucial step comprised managing missing data and grouping protected class variables into distinct subcategories. These preprocessing tasks were accomplished using powerful data manipulation libraries in Python, such as pandas and numpy, to shape the data into a format ready for insightful analysis.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="process-step">
            <h3>Bias Detection</h3>
            <p>After preprocessing, the project focused on bias detection. Using fairness metrics such as Statistical Parity Difference (SPD) and Disparate Impact (DI), the dataset was scrutinized for potential biases in relation to protected attributes like gender and age. These metrics were calculated using the AI Fairness 360 (AIF360) toolkit, a comprehensive library designed to help users examine, report, and mitigate discrimination and bias in machine learning models.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="process-step">
            <h3>Bias Mitigation</h3>
            <p>The final stage of the project centered on bias mitigation. The Disparate Impact Remover (DIR) algorithm from the AIF360 toolkit was applied to the dataset, which works by adjusting the distributions of privileged and unprivileged groups for each feature to be more similar. The effectiveness of the bias mitigation process was then evaluated by calculating and comparing the fairness metrics before and after mitigation, demonstrating the impact of the mitigation process.</p>
