				<h2>Background</h2>
				<p>The lending market, especially for affordable housing projects, is a complex space with many players involved in each deal. As a lender, maintaining consistency and efficiency while scaling the deal volume can be a significant challenge. The management of these deals is often manual and relies heavily on the expertise of individual team members. This can lead to issues regarding scalability and contract compliance as the number of deals increases.</p>
				<p>My team was engaged by a top national multifamily lender to provide an external perspective and enhance their new lending product, an innovative solution for constructing and rehabilitating affordable housing projects. Our challenge was to streamline the deal execution process and product pipeline to ensure scalability as deal volumes increased.</p>
				<p>To address this, we proposed a "toolkit," a three-component solution consisting of a Deal Execution Checklist, a Deal Execution Tools, and Deal Execution Processes and Artifacts. Each component targeted a specific aspect of the deal execution process to ensure consistency, efficiency, and alignment across the team.</p>
				<h2>Implementation</h2>
				<p>The implementation of our solution involved the development and integration of the three components:</p>
				<h4>Role</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Management Consultant:</b> Responsible for developing the toolkit, guiding the client through the implementation process, and ensuring alignment with the client's operational needs and objectives.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Key Features</h4>
				<ul>
					<li><b>Deal Execution Checklist:</b> This tool ensured that every step of the process was tracked and communicated, helping to maintain consistency and streamline the pipeline.</li>
					<li><b>Deal Execution Tools:</b> A consolidation of templates and tools for documenting key artifacts, including a standard deal timeline, role matrix, and terms summary. This package served as a single reference point for key information, ensuring alignment across the team and reducing the risk of overlooked steps.</li>
					<li><b>Deal Execution Processes and Artifacts:</b> Detailed guidelines developed to guide new team members and serve as a reference for all, driving consistency in execution and clearly delineating roles and responsibilities.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Results</h4>
				<p>The implementation of the toolkit led to tangible improvements in the client's operations:</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Streamlined execution process: The Deal Execution Checklist and Deal Execution Tools helped reduce manual labor and improve team communication, making the execution process more efficient.</li>
					<li>Standardized processes and artifacts: The standardization of key artifacts drove consistency and ensured compliance with contract requirements.</li>
					<li>Improved scalability: With the new streamlined process and clear process documentation, the client was equipped to handle a higher volume of deals without sacrificing efficiency or quality.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>This engagement was instrumental in paving the way for the successful construction and rehabilitation of more affordable housing projects.</p>
